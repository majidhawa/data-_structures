# Heaps

## Introduction

Heaps are a type of binary tree-based data structure constrained by a heap property. They are nearly complete binary trees. There are two types of heaps: Min Heap and Max Heap.

## Types of Heaps

- **Min Heap**: A type of heap where the parent node has a value less than or equal to its child nodes.
- **Max Heap**: A type of heap where the parent node has a value greater than or equal to its child nodes.

## Advantages of Using Heaps

- **Efficient Insertion and Deletion**: Heaps allow efficient addition and removal of elements.
- **Guaranteed Access to Max and Min Element**: You can easily access the maximum or minimum element in a heap.
- **Space Efficiency**: Heaps are more space-efficient than other data structures like balanced binary search trees.

## Disadvantages of Using Heaps

- **Lack of Flexibility**: Heaps offer limited flexibility compared to other data structures.
- **Not Suitable for Sorting**: While heaps can efficiently manage priorities, they are not ideal for sorting elements.
- **Inefficient for Searching**: Searching for an element in a heap is not as efficient as in other data structures.
- **Uncertain for Certain Operations**: Some operations, like finding the median, are not straightforward or guaranteed to be efficient in heaps.

## Applications of a Heap

- **Priority Queues**: Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues.
- **Selection Algorithms**: For example, finding the smallest element in a list.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Heaps are used in allocating and deallocating memory dynamically.
- **Algorithms**: Used in various algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm to find the node of the smallest distance.

Heaps are a powerful data structure with specific use cases, particularly where efficient management of priorities is required.
