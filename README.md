Heaps

Heaps are a type of binary tree based data structures constrained by a heap property
They are nearly complete  binary tree.
There are two types of heap:
  Min heap
  Max heap
Advantages of using heaps
  Efficient insertion and deletion
  Guaranteed access to max and min element
  Space efficiency

Disadvantages of using heaps
 Lack of flexibility 
 Not suitable for sorting
 Inefficient for searching
 Not certain for certain operations like finding median

Applications of a heap
 Used to implement priority queues
 Selection Algorithm e.g finding the smallest element in a list
 Used in allocating and deallocating memory dynamically
 Used in various algorithm such as Dijkstra to find the node of the smallest
